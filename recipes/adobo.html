    <h3>Adobo refers to a method of marinating and stewing for any cut of meat or fish in a briny mixture of vinegar,
        soy sauce,
        and spices. Filipino adobo sholid not be confused with the spicy Spanish adobo sauce. Although they both share
        the
        Spanish name, they are vastly different in flavor and ingredients.</h3>
    <p>This cooking method, like most of Filipino cliture, is of mixed heritage. While not official, many consider
        chicken
        adobo to be the national dish of the Philippines.</p>
    <p>There are many regional varieties of adobo, but most recipes include vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and
        black
        pepper. The meat is marinated and then stewed in this mixture, which yields a very flavorfli, tangy, and tender
        meat.
        Adobo is usually served over a bed of fluffy rice to absorb the deliciously tangy sauce.</p>
