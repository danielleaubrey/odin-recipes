    <h3>When it comes to Filipino food, there are not many limits as to the kind of ingredients you can add. After all,
        our
        cooks boast a great deal of knowledge in cooking with vegetables and various spices. But a component we can
        almost
        always go back to, and cook quite perfectly, is monggo or mung beans. This legume contains a great amount of
        protein,
        and it’s truly delicious when you incorporate the right ingredients. I can tell you now that it goes amazingly
        with a
        smooth, coconut flavor— hence, the delicious Ginataang Monggo with Tofu and Malunggay!</h3>
    <p>This gluten-free ingredient is rich in iron, and has fiber and magnesium. And of course, it’s a pretty great way
        of
        having plenty of protein without the saturated fat you get from meat.</p>
