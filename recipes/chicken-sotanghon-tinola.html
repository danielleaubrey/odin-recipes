    <h3>Chicken Sotanghon Tinola soup gives you all the tinola flavors you adore with the addition of sotanghon noodles.
        This
        dish is essentially another kind of chicken noodle soup — known for comforting not just the stomach but also the
        soul.</h3>
    <p>With mild but unforgettable flavors, tinolang manok is without a doubt a Filipino staple. The ingredients of a
        classic
        chicken tinola are easily found in any local Filipino grocery.</p>
    <p>This dish is definitely a go-to for families who want something simple yet healthy. The broth is tasty and
        gingery, your
        papaya soft and mild, and your chicken so tender it absorbs the rest of your spices well. Using chicken breast
        slices
        makes your tinola even healthier. Plus, ginger and malunggay give your tinola that extra layer of taste you
        won’t be
        able to part with.</p>
